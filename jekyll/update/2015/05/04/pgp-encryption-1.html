    <p class="post-meta">May 4, 2015</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve been working with different methods for using message and file encryption, using PGP. Here are a lot of lessons I’ve learned in the process. </p>

<p>“PGP” is an acronym for “Pretty Good Privacy.” This humble moniker vastly understates this technology’s capability. PGP is literally “the closest you’re likely to get to military-grade encryption.”</p>

<p>There are several ways to use this technology, so I’ll try to clarify the areas of ambiguity that emerge from using several platforms. </p>

<h2 id="the-way-it-works">The Way It Works</h2>

<p>For PGP, everyone generates a public key and a private key. You share your public key with everyone on some form of keyserver. To send an encrypted file or message to someone else, you use his/her public key so that person is the only person able to decrypt the message. That person must use his/her secret matching key and passphrase for the decryption to work.</p>

<h3 id="quick-historical-tidbit-and-naming-clarification">Quick Historical Tidbit and Naming Clarification</h3>

<p>First of all, some tools use the name “GPG” instead of “PGP”, and this form of encryption is entirely compatible. The different names arose simply from historical reasons. PGP is a proprietary technology owned by Symantec, and GPG (and OpenPGP) developed as a free alternative. </p>

<p>I have also heard from a couple people that sharing PGP was disallowed by the US government. However, academic papers were out there explaining how to implement it. From grokking these papers, people in Europe were able to develop GPG. I have neither confirmed nor rejected this story. Please reach out to me if you know.</p>

<h1 id="great-pgp-resources">Great PGP Resources</h1>

<p>So far, I’ve found 3 different ways of sharing PGP-encrypted messages and files: <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPG Tools Suite</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a>, &amp; <a href="https://github.com/git-crypt/git-crypt/">gitcrypt</a>. I’ll provide resources for setting each up and discuss their quirks.</p>

<h2 id="gpg-tools-suite-for-mac">GPG Tools Suite (for Mac)</h2>

<p>If you would like a desktop application, try <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPG Tools Suite</a>. The best starter for setting up this tool is <a href="http://notes.jerzygangi.com/the-best-pgp-tutorial-for-mac-os-x-ever/">here on Jerzy Gangi’s blog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-nice-parts">The Nice Parts</h3>

<p>The blog post shows you how to use this tool, but there are some nice facts to know and intriguing challenges to using GPG Tools. 
- First, you have have to make sure to enable the actions of signing, encrypting, decrypting, and verifying by going to System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts and clicking the checkbox next to each of the OpenPGP actions.
- After that, you can right-click any highlighted text or file and go to the Services sub-menu</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>You need to search for any of your friends on the GPG Tools keyserver. This process is relatively easy. You open your GPG Keychain and Lookup Key, where you enter the person’s name or email address. The challenge is knowing whether that person’s key is still up-to-date. A lot of people may have keys available on this keyserver that they don’t use anymore. There are some PGP that are becoming more popular, so you may think that you’re properly sending someone a message/file to a 3-year-old </p>

<h2 id="posts-to-come">Posts to Come</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoy checking out GPG Tools Suite. It’s worth having set up even if you check out and enjoy using the other tools I will write about in the posts to follow. These posts will be on Keybase.io and gitcrypt.</p>
